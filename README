Musescore.com Experiments
=========================

This repository contains some Perl modules wrapping over the
Musescore.com user-contributed score library API as well as a basic
MusicXML API. It also includes some basic MusicXML feature extractors,
hence its intended use as a tool for experimentation.

It was developed during Music Hack Day London on 3/4 December 2011.
